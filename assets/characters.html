                        <p>Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine pseudonym "Heisenberg", is the main protagonist of Breaking Bad. He was a chemist and a former chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who, after being diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung cancer, started manufacturing crystal methamphetamine to both pay for his treatments and provide for his family in the event of his passing. He is the central character of the series, and is portrayed as a protagonist, antagonist and antihero. As the series progresses, Walter gradually becomes darker and takes on a more villainous role.</p>

He is the former partner of Walter White in the methamphetamine drug trade. Jesse was a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer, and dealer. He was also an inattentive student in Walter White's chemistry class, leading to his dropping out. In his mid-20s, Jesse became Walt's business partner in the meth trade. Before his partnership with Walt, he, operating under the pseudonym "Cap'n Cook", added a little Chili powder to make his methamphetamine stand out in the market.</p>

Despite a rough patch in their relationship as Hank recovers, their marriage becomes loving again when Hank begins making progress with the Heisenberg case and she becomes stable enough to care emotionally for her family members. When Walt and Skyler begin to visibly have marriage problems, she volunteers to house the kids for a couple of days while they work things out. Marie loves the color purple, and nearly all her household and clothing items are various shades of purple.</p>

His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Jimmy became a scam artist in Cicero and soon gained the nickname "Slippin' Jimmy" for staging "slip and fall" accidents to make quick cash. Jimmy runs into trouble with the police and Chuck returns to help but requires that Jimmy join him in Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Jimmy befriends Kim Wexler, an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completes his college degree and attends a correspondence law school. He passes the bar exam and hopes to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner Howard Hamlin denies Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then starts a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic Mike Ehrmantraut, a former police officer working as the clerk at the courthouse's parking lot.

They were also the grandsons of Abuelita and they had three cousins connected to criminal actions: Tuco, Lalo and Joaquin Salamanca. They were typically dressed in well-cut sharkskin suits and distinctive cowboy boots tipped with silver skulls, and appeared to worship the Mexican deity of death Santa Muerte, making offerings to a shrine when undertaking an assassination.</p>
